[Learning COBOL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-cobol)
- Author: Peggy Fisher
- Duration: 3h 4m
- Completed: 4/21/2020
- Details: COBOL is an endangered language. But it once ran 80% of the world's business systems: thousands of mission-critical applications that still exist today. Some companies want to upgrade and transition their COBOL applications to more modern frameworks; others want to stick with COBOL's relatively stable platform. In either case, hiring managers are willing to pay a premium for candidates who know how to take on COBOL's challenges. For this reason, programmers are learning COBOL again.

This course is designed to help new and experienced programmers alike add COBOL (or add COBOL back) to their skill set. Peggy Fisher shows how to get a COBOL development environment up and running and how to start programming. She reviews COBOL's data types and constants, control structures, file storage and processing methods, tables, and strings. Challenges issued along the way will help you practice what you've learned.

[Learning Kali Linux](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-kali-linux)
- Author: Malcolm Shore
- Duration: 2h 31m
- Completed: 1/3/2020
- Details: Kali Linux is a flavor of Linux targeted at digital forensics experts and penetration (pen) testers. It includes over 400 pen-testing programs, and it is the primary tool used by ethical hackers. Using Kali Linux, certified ethical hackers can test networks on their organizations' behalves, to see if they're vulnerable to outside attacks.

This course will give prospective ethical hackers a short overview of the tools in Kali Linux. Cybersecurity expert Malcolm Shore shows how to set up a virtual environment for testing, configure Kali Linux, and install toolsets for information gathering, vulnerability assessment, password and hash cracking, and target exploitation.

Because businesses are connected, they are also exposed. Vulnerability testing helps organizations limit that exposure. This course will help you explore the careers, techniques, and tools behind ethical hacking—one of the most competitive and sought-after IT security skills.

- Author: Lisa Bock
- Duration: 1h 20m
- Completed: 1/2/2020
- Details: Ethical hackers: Get an inside look into the tools the black hat hackers use to "sniff" network traffic, and discover how to countermeasure such attacks. Security ambassador Lisa Bock explains what a sniffer is, and how hackers use it to intercept network traffic. She reviews the seven-layer OSI model, active vs. passive attacks, and the different types of protocol attacks, including MAC and macof attacks, DNS caching and forgery, DHCP denial-of-service attacks, and ARP cache poisoning. Learn how ethical hackers have an arsenal of tools to emulate these attacks and techniques, from examining headers and URLs to capturing images. Lisa relies on Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows, but also introduces other sniffing tools, including TShark, tcpdump, and CloudShark.

- Completed: 12/30/2019
- Details: Wireshark Essential Training provides a solid overview of deep packet inspection by stepping through the basics of packet capture and analysis using Wireshark. In this course, Lisa Bock helps you understand the field values of the protocols and what's considered normal behavior using precaptured packets from online repositories. Lisa helps you navigate through the many features of Wireshark. She begins by stressing the benefits of traffic analysis and discussing how this powerful tool can be used to examine traffic either live from wired or wireless connections. She compares the legacy and next generation versions of Wireshark, demonstrates how to install this tool on a PC and on a Mac, and explores the Wireshark interface. She then moves into deep packet analysis of common protocols such as TCP, IP, DHCP, and DNS. To wrap up, she summarizes working with packet captures, discusses the Wireshark expert system, and goes over how Wireshark can help detect network latency issues. She also illustrates ways to subset traffic and then share captures using CloudShark. Lisa walks participants through the basics, so no previous experience with Wireshark is necessary.

[Learning GraphQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-graphql)
- Author: Eve Porcello
- Duration: 52m
- Completed: 6/22/2019
- Details: Data-driven applications depend on remote queries that run through APIs. For years, web services have provided basic support for simple query structures. Those services, however, often constrained developers who needed more granular approaches that provided flexibility without creating a huge collection of unnecessary calls. GraphQL—a query language for APIs that was originally built by Facebook—allows developers to choose the kinds of requests they want to make, and receive information on multiple facets of that query in one request. The GraphQL approach to querying across networks can address a wide variety of large-scale development problems.

In this course, learn how to get started with GraphQL. Eve Porcello walks through the basics of this query language, diving into the data fetching specification, and helping you get up to speed with the syntax and vocabulary of GraphQL. Eve explains how to create basic queries, including how to work with arguments and multiple fields. She also goes into complex techniques for handling data, including working with aliases, fragments, and pagination. Plus, she covers how to edit and transform data with mutations.
