      This a summary of all the Linked-In courses I have completed. 
      This is just the direct LinkedIn Learning courses.  There are a number of "Lynda.com"
      courses that were taken before subscribing to the LinkedIn premium plan.
      </p>
      <p>
      This list is generated from a tool called "pup-learning" that can be found

      site to gather the list of courses I have taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you look over the list of courses, there is variety.  I fully admit that
        my attention for some courses was less that other.  My form of bing watching :)

                <li class="details">Ethical hacking—testing to see if an organization's network is vulnerable to outside attacks—is a desired skill for many IT security professionals. In this course, cybersecurity expert Malcolm Shore prepares you to take your first steps into testing client defenses. Malcolm provides you with an overview of firewall technology, detailing how firewalls work in both Windows and Linux, as well as how to set up a firewall simulation in a GNS3 network. Next, he goes over web application firewalls, API gateway threat mitigation solutions, and how to use honeypots to detect intruders. Finally, he covers the main ways to manage a suspected intrusion, including how to use the Security Onion intrusion detection system (IDS).

Note: The topics covered in this course are drawn from the Evading IDS, Firewalls, and Honeypots competency in the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) body of knowledge.</li>

                <li class="details">Ansible is an easy-to-use IT automation engine. It can transform and optimize tasks such as rolling updates with just a few lines of code. However, many organizations aren't using Ansible modules and playbooks in a reusable fashion; they are reinventing the wheel every time they automate. This training course introduces intermediate to advanced use cases for using the tool at scale. Instructor Robert Starmer shows how to reuse Ansible functionality with roles, encrypt secret data with Ansible Vault, support idempotence, and manage multiple groups of systems with Ansible Tower. He shows you how to string these concepts together to use Ansible in the most efficient way possible: variablizing resources, capturing your ideas into roles, and extending Ansible from simple server management to network management-and beyond.</li>

                <li class="details">Research indicates that likability can be equally if not more important than competence when hiring managers are making decisions. Likability also helps you succeed once you land the job: Likable employees get more assistance and earn more promotions. In this course, you can learn simple techniques for making yourself a more appealing candidate by shifting behaviors that influence how others perceive you, ultimately becoming more likable to your network and the decision-makers in the hiring process. Dr. Dawn Graham—career director for the Executive MBA Program at the Wharton School and a former recruiter—helps you tap into and enhance your natural likability, build your network, and start off your new role on a positive note.</li>

                <li class="details">COBOL is an endangered language. But it once ran 80% of the world's business systems: thousands of mission-critical applications that still exist today. Some companies want to upgrade and transition their COBOL applications to more modern frameworks; others want to stick with COBOL's relatively stable platform. In either case, hiring managers are willing to pay a premium for candidates who know how to take on COBOL's challenges. For this reason, programmers are learning COBOL again.

This course is designed to help new and experienced programmers alike add COBOL (or add COBOL back) to their skill set. Peggy Fisher shows how to get a COBOL development environment up and running and how to start programming. She reviews COBOL's data types and constants, control structures, file storage and processing methods, tables, and strings. Challenges issued along the way will help you practice what you've learned.</li>

                <li class="details">Industrial automation is the use of computers and robots to control industrial processes, like manufacturing, without significant human intervention. Used correctly, automation can increase the quality, safety, and accuracy of these processes. It's the job of the people in industrial automation to design the systems, configure the controllers, and monitor the processes. This course provides an overview of the topic, designed to help anyone hoping to enter the field in a role such as electrical or mechanical engineer, automation technician, or design manager.

Learn about the components and networks involved at each level of automation: field level, control level, and management level. Explore the different devices involved, from the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) on the factory floor, to OPC software that give technicians insights into operations. Instructor Zahraa Khalil, an engineer and educator, also provides an overview of SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition), an industrial control system architecture that enables supervision over large distances and multiple sites.</li>

                <li class="details">All major browsers include developer tools, which enable developers to examine the code of a webpage or app, as well as run tests and evaluate metrics related to that code. Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short) is the industry standard. Explore how the tools work in actual testing and debugging scenarios and get an expanded toolbox for your day-to-day work. This course teaches the most widely used parts of DevTools, using sample files to walk through identifying issues and bugs, fixing them, and then verifying that they've been fixed. Each chapter digs into a different tool, including the Console, Elements panel, and Network panel, exploring how it's useful and when to use it. Author and educator Sasha Vodnik helps you explore the DOM, examine errors, look at source files, identify bottlenecks in page loads, and more. Start watching and get started with Chrome DevTools today.</li>

                <li class="details">In network communications, knowing where something came from can often be as important as what it contains. Browsers can be particular about this, sometimes surprising developers when things can't be reached or connected. In this course, learn how same-origin policies play an important role in web security, so you can develop secure, interactive sites. Find out how to build Ajax requests using headers that affect the origin, how to work with server-only cookies, how to create secure communications between browser windows or tabs from the same origin, and more.</li>

                <li class="details">It seems like there is a security-related incident in the news every day. What makes systems—and the software that runs them—vulnerable to attack? The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) was formed to provide the public with the resources to understand and improve software security. The OWASP Top 10 list describes the ten biggest vulnerabilities. In this course, application security expert Caroline Wong provides an overview of the 2017 OWASP Top 10, presenting information about each vulnerability category, its prevalence, and its impact. Though aimed at IT security professionals and developers, anyone who uses web applications will benefit from an understanding of these risks.

                <li class="details">In a field where reproducible results are essential, Docker is rapidly emerging as one of the top tools for bringing efficiency to the work that data science teams—particularly those working in machine learning (ML)—are doing. Creating and developing ML models is often messy. Seasoned data scientists know that different versions of the same software can produce different results. With Docker, you can include the right versions of each needed dependency and library, so no one ever has to do any configuration. After the Dockerfile is built, you'll have exactly what you need. In this course, Jonathan Fernandes helps data scientists get up and running with Docker, demonstrating how to build a Dockerized ML application that can easily be shared. Along the way, he shares common use cases for the tool. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll be prepared to leverage the power of containers in your other ML projects.</li>

                <li class="details">Kali Linux is a flavor of Linux targeted at digital forensics experts and penetration (pen) testers. It includes over 400 pen-testing programs, and it is the primary tool used by ethical hackers. Using Kali Linux, certified ethical hackers can test networks on their organizations' behalves, to see if they're vulnerable to outside attacks.

This course will give prospective ethical hackers a short overview of the tools in Kali Linux. Cybersecurity expert Malcolm Shore shows how to set up a virtual environment for testing, configure Kali Linux, and install toolsets for information gathering, vulnerability assessment, password and hash cracking, and target exploitation.

Because businesses are connected, they are also exposed. Vulnerability testing helps organizations limit that exposure. This course will help you explore the careers, techniques, and tools behind ethical hacking—one of the most competitive and sought-after IT security skills.</li>

                <li class="details">Ethical hackers: Get an inside look into the tools the black hat hackers use to "sniff" network traffic, and discover how to countermeasure such attacks. Security ambassador Lisa Bock explains what a sniffer is, and how hackers use it to intercept network traffic. She reviews the seven-layer OSI model, active vs. passive attacks, and the different types of protocol attacks, including MAC and macof attacks, DNS caching and forgery, DHCP denial-of-service attacks, and ARP cache poisoning. Learn how ethical hackers have an arsenal of tools to emulate these attacks and techniques, from examining headers and URLs to capturing images. Lisa relies on Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows, but also introduces other sniffing tools, including TShark, tcpdump, and CloudShark.

                <li class="details">Docker is the next step beyond virtualization. A Docker image contains everything it needs to run, independent of the Linux server on which it lives: a copy of the operating system, a database, code, configuration files, dependencies, and so on. Images can also be packaged and shared with other Docker admins. Arthur Ulfeldt uses Docker to run complex systems with millions of users and hundreds of containers. Here, he shares his knowledge with you. He introduces the basics of Docker, including its containers, Dockerfiles (or base images), and capabilities for networking, data management, infrastructure optimization, and more. Watch and learn how to build your own containers, as well as how to network and link containers.</li>

                <li class="details">For decades, CSS developers fiddled with floats to create flexible layouts that worked across browsers. But their brilliant hack had a lot of downsides. The latest generation of CSS specs offers a better and vastly more intuitive set of tools, but moving from floats to Grid, Flexbox, or both means adjusting how you think. In this course, Christina Truong guides you though this process, from initial concepts to complete conversion, highlighting the different ways to create page layouts with modern CSS. Explore how to work with the display and float properties; use relative, absolute, and fixed positioning for laying out components; create basic Grid and Flexbox layouts; and more.</li>

With Jenkins, you can automate build management, continuous integration and deployment, testing, resource management, monitoring and reporting, and much more. This introduction helps you use Jenkins to release and deploy software more quickly and reliably.

First, learn how to set up Jenkins on Mac, Windows, Linux, or inside a Docker container, and find out how Jenkins plugins are used to extend its functionality. Next, configure your first job step by step, leading up to the requisite "Hello, World" output, and learn to make your jobs more useful and portable with parameters. Then explore job scheduling, and Jenkins's convenient aliases for running jobs at regular intervals. The course wraps up with tips for organizing jobs in folders and views and a brief look into pipelines as code-which enable you to execute a series of jobs in stages.

By the end of the training, you should be able to install Jenkins locally or on a virtual machine, create a Jenkins jobs that can be triggered manually or on a schedule, and install and configure plugins to extend the Jenkins framework.</li>

                <li class="details">Communication is a complex art. Listening, making oneself understood, and persuasion are all elements of what it means to communicate effectively. Great communicators must master these skills and apply them strategically, depending on what they’re trying to achieve in a given context. You might use the art of narrative storytelling to get your team excited about a project. In a negotiation, you might deliberately signal a willingness to walk away in order to prompt the other side to action. Or if your goal is to understand the ideas and intentions of a new colleague, you might ask a series of sincere, open-ended questions. This course is designed to prepare you for all of these situations and more, offering tips, strategies, and broad observations from professional communicators in many different roles—from an award-winning actor, to an FBI hostage negotiator, to an astronaut on the International Space Station. Note: Some videos assume a group of learners is available for team activities and discussions. Please use what’s useful and feel free to adapt the lessons to your particular circumstances. This course includes videos from: Alan Alda, Emmy-winning actor, writer, and director Nancy Duarte, communication expert Jeffrey Wright, Tony-winning actor from Angels in America Chris Voss, lead negotiator for the Federal Bureau of Investigation Colonel Chris Hadfield, Canadian astronaut Note: This course was produced by Big Think.

                <li class="details">Data-driven applications depend on remote queries that run through APIs. For years, web services have provided basic support for simple query structures. Those services, however, often constrained developers who needed more granular approaches that provided flexibility without creating a huge collection of unnecessary calls. GraphQL—a query language for APIs that was originally built by Facebook—allows developers to choose the kinds of requests they want to make, and receive information on multiple facets of that query in one request. The GraphQL approach to querying across networks can address a wide variety of large-scale development problems.

In this course, learn how to get started with GraphQL. Eve Porcello walks through the basics of this query language, diving into the data fetching specification, and helping you get up to speed with the syntax and vocabulary of GraphQL. Eve explains how to create basic queries, including how to work with arguments and multiple fields. She also goes into complex techniques for handling data, including working with aliases, fragments, and pagination. Plus, she covers how to edit and transform data with mutations.</li>
